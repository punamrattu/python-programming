"""
You work as a primary school teacher and are teaching numbers by showing how they are composed of units of ten and one. Write a program for students to play with to understand this concept. You will be asking for them to enter numbers between 1 and 25 (they havenâ€™t gone higher than that!), so you do not need to consider bigger numbers. The function needs to print to the screen and the message must be grammatically correct and in the format shown below.

# Define text formats based on the number's digits
